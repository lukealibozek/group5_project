## Roles:

|Team member    |D1         |D2         |D3     |D4     |
|---            |---        |---        |---    |---    |
|Lawrence       |X          |Square     |       |       |

|Jamie/David    |Triangle   |Triangle   |       |       |
|Luke           |Square     |Circle     |       |       |

Let's take a look at how these assignments are distributed across the roles:

- **Team**: Continue with analysis: add, commit, push, create new branches as needed, and utilize GitHub's built-in tools, such as PRs, to review the work you and your teammates have completed (this is an ongoing process, so keep it up!).
- **Square**: Refine the machine learning model you'll be using (train and test).
- **Triangle**: Transform the mockup database into a full database that integrates with your work.
- **Circle**: Continue with analysis and create visuals to accompany the data story.
- **X**: Outline and begin work on a dashboard to house your final project. Check and test the work completed against the rubric.
