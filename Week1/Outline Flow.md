# Project Background
1. What is the question we want to answer (Hypothesis)
2. Explain the Dataset and variable types

# Data Preprocessing PYTHON
1. Bring data into python
2. Compute any missing percentages
3. Impute values if applicable
4. Compute summary statistics
5. Create dummy variables if applicable

# DATABASE with PG
1. Merge the Data Sets to make a database

# Data Modeling PYTHON
1. Pull database into python to complete ETL requirement
2. Modeling Techniques
  A. Decision Tree - Conditional control statements (Good for demographic data ad non-linear data sets - categorical ad continuous variables)
  B. Logistic Regression - Models probability of output (Assumes linearity between dependent and independent variables)
  C. Time Series Model - Quantitative forecasting that uses chronologically arranged data to develop forecasts
  D. Discriminant Analysis- Discriminate analysis gives us an average misclassification by catorgizing variables (only works on categorical data)
  E. KNN - Relatively hig acuracy, useful for nonlinear data

# Visualizations
1. Output into CSV
2. Tableau Maps and dashboards showing county data broken down into categories
